## `GitHubActions` PowerShell Module

This PowerShell module can be used to interact with the environment during the run of a
GitHub Actions Workflow.

It is based on the specification for [Workflow commands for GitHub Actions](
    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions)
and is an adaptation of the [JavaScript interface](
    https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/a6e72497764b1cf53192eb720f551d7f0db3a4b4/packages/core/src)
from the [GitHub Actions Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).

Checkout the [documentation](./docs/GitHubActions/README.md) for the module cmdlets.
